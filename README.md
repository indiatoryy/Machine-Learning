## Course Information
### Course Name
ECE421: Introduction to Machine Learning

### Course Description
An Introduction to the basic theory, the fundamental algorithms, and the computational toolboxes of machine learning. The focus is on a balanced treatment of the practical and theoretical approaches, along with hands on experience with relevant software packages. Supervised learning methods covered in the course will include: the study of linear models for classification and regression, neural networks and support vector machines. Unsupervised learning methods covered in the course will include: principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. Theoretical topics will include: bounds on the generalization error, bias-variance tradeoffs and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. Techniques to control overfitting, including regularization and validation, will be covered.

## 1. K-Means Algorithm
K-Means is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering and data segmentation. The goal of clustering is to group similar data points together, allowing data scientists and researchers to uncover patterns, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions. K-Means achieves this by partitioning a dataset into K clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid, which is the mean of all data points in the cluster.

## 2. Comparing Binary Linear Classifier and SVM
In this comparison project, a binary linear classifier and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) are empirically evaluated using the Iris dataset. The binary linear classifier and SVM are implemented using scikit-learn. The project explores various aspects such as implementing decision boundaries, reporting accuracy, understanding support vectors, and analyzing the impact of dataset size on the models' performance. The README provides a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical background behind binary linear classification and SVM, offering a clear guide on their implementations and comparisons.

## 3. Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks
Assignment 4 encompasses various tasks focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. In the first part, students understand data splits and implement custom convolution filters and linear layers. Part 2 delves into training and tuning a CNN, where students optimize models, observe training progress, and explore hyperparameters. Part 3 introduces a new dataset, requiring partitioning, model creation, and hyperparameter tuning, with a focus on achieving improved accuracy. In the final section, students conduct an open-ended exploration, experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, exploring interactions between hyperparameters, comparing optimizers, or using pre-trained models. The emphasis is on detailed discussions about problem-solving approaches and model evaluations. 

## 4. Sentiment Analysis Using Gated-Recurrent Neural Networks
This sentiment analysis project focuses on classifying movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative using Gated-Recurrent Neural Networks (GRUs). The README explains essential concepts like one-hot encoding, word embeddings, and GRU architectures. It details the model's components, including embedding layers and fully-connected layers, and explores optimization techniques such as SGD and Adam optimizers. Additionally, the README guides users through implementing early stopping methods to prevent overfitting. The document provides a comprehensive overview, enabling users to understand and implement sentiment analysis techniques effectively.
