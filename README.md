# ECE421 Machine Learning Assignments
## ECE421: Introudction to Machine Learning
An Introduction to the basic theory, the fundamental algorithms, and the computational toolboxes of machine learning. The focus is on a balanced treatment of the practical and theoretical approaches, along with hands on experience with relevant software packages. Supervised learning methods covered in the course will include: the study of linear models for classification and regression, neural networks and support vector machines. Unsupervised learning methods covered in the course will include: principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. Theoretical topics will include: bounds on the generalization error, bias-variance tradeoffs and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. Techniques to control overfitting, including regularization and validation, will be covered.

## 1. K-Means Algorithm
K-Means is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering and data segmentation. The goal of clustering is to group similar data points together, allowing data scientists and researchers to uncover patterns, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions. K-Means achieves this by partitioning a dataset into K clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid, which is the mean of all data points in the cluster.
